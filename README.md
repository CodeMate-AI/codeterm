# CodeMate AI Terminal

**Version**: 0.0.1  
**Product Name**: CodeTerm  
**Description**: An open-source AI powered terminal for the next-gen developers to master command line on Day one.

## Introduction

CodeTerm is an open-source terminal designed to enhance the command-line interface (CLI) experience with context-driven AI integration. It includes essential features such as integrated terminal with Natural language to command functionality, directory navigation, a built-in code/text editor, and AI-powered chat to generate code snippets with preview compoment. By leveraging the efficiency of the CLI alongside the intelligence of AI, CodeTerm offers a unified environment where users can seamlessly execute text-based commands and receive dynamic, context-aware assistance.

CodeTerm is a revolutionary terminal that redefines how we interact with command-line interfaces. Traditionally, thereâ€™s been a clear distinction between the speed and efficiency of the CLI and the need for custom themes, copy/paste functionality, scrolling, and adjustable fonts, which often require separate web-based tools. CodeTerm eliminates this by merging the best features of both CLI and graphical based interfaces into one cohesive, AI powered terminal, providing a seamless experience that caters to all your command-line and graphical needs.
